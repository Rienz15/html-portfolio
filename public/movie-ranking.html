<h1>The Best Movies According to Rienz</h1>
<h2>Three Movies/Series I liked</h2>
<hr />
<h3>3 Centimeters Per Second</h3>
<p>Super sad movie and hopeless romantic, too.</p>
<h3>First Love</h3>
<p>Not really a movie, but a Netflix series. It's a roller coaster of emotions.</p>
<h3>Earth Maiden Arjuna</h3>
<p>Also not a movie, but an anime series. It's philosophical, deep. I like philosophical stuff.</p>
